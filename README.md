I had little experience with html but no knowlege of css and javascript before starting the project.
I have worked with pyhton and c++ but web dev was completely new to me so I started to learn html and css
and it was not that hard but due to lack of time I could not work that much on this project but I did some basic html and css stuff and uploaded it.
